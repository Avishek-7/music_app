# Sample Audio Files

This directory contains sample audio files for testing the music player.

## Note about Audio Files

Due to file size limitations, this directory contains placeholder information. In a real deployment, you would add your own audio files here.

## Recommended Test Files

For testing the music player, you can add audio files in the following formats:

### Supported Formats:
- **MP3** (.mp3) - Most common format
- **WAV** (.wav) - Uncompressed, high quality
- **OGG** (.ogg) - Open source format
- **M4A** (.m4a) - Apple audio format

### Suggested Test Files:
1. `sample-song-1.mp3` - A short song for testing
2. `sample-song-2.wav` - Different format testing
3. `ambient-sound.ogg` - Background music testing
4. `podcast-clip.m4a` - Voice content testing

## How to Add Your Own Files

1. Copy your audio files to this directory
2. Launch the music player
3. Use the "Add Song" button to upload files
4. Or drag and drop files directly onto the upload area

## File Naming Conventions

For best results, name your files descriptively:
- `Artist - Song Title.mp3`
- `Album Name - Track Number - Song.wav`
- Avoid special characters that might cause issues

The music player will automatically extract the song title from the filename and display it in the playlist.
